Here's what our team is working on so far:

**Name**: FilQR
**Description**: First ever decentralized QR Code generator powered by Filecoin and web3.storage
**Github**: https://github.com/akhileshthite/filqr
**Idea**: FVM-powered QR code generator that uploads the content to IPFS by using web3.storage and generates "decentralized QR codes".
It's a web3 alternative to bit.ly's qr-code-generator where you can generate decentralized QR codes for everything such as text, social media links, vCards, coupons, music, video, pdf, etc.
Say no more to centralized, breakable, costly, and data-selling QR code services!
**Blockers**: Nope.
